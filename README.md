Right in front of my house is a public guest parking lot. There's usually a few spots open, but likely not enough for everyone.

My recommended alternative parking lot is the Spinnaker Cove (apartments) parking lot.
It's technically a private lot, but its always empty and we're close by and only around for a few hours.
Access this lot by driving through Sea Spray Ln. 
If you park here, you can walk to my house by going around the left side of the tennis court.

Another alternative parking lot is in the Jewish Community Center across the main street.
It's also technically a private lot, but its always empty and no one polices it.

Finally, there's a Bank of America around the corner that has public parking.
If you park here, its a 4-5 minute walk to my house.
