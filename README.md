The building is next to a few restuaraunts with a large public parking lot. Park anywhere!

Its a short walk from the parking lot past the restuaraunts and into our building. If you're uncomfortable wearing your costume outside, feel free to change once inside!

You'll see a big 1079 in the front of the building. The condo is on the third floor. Message me or Natalie that you're walking over and we'll let you in.
